# Code Of Conduct

- To have consistent commit messages we have oriented ourselves to the [Commit Message Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/brianclements/841ea7bffdb01346392c).

- To create a pull request use the provided [pull request template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). This allows a consistent review schedule.

- If multiple persons work on a commit, for example for pair programming, use the co-author syntax: [Creating a commit with multiple authors](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors).

## Backend

- To ensure a high code quality in the backend code, use black (Python code formatter). Use also the linters/tools: flake8, bandit, pyupgrade, pydocstyle, pyright, pylint and autoflake to make sure that the code quality has a high standard. 
  
- Before committing and pushing the Code to GitHub execute the unit tests first for backend code.
